        <h1> 1. Implement a function that checks the correctness of the personal identity number.</h1> 
        <h2> Input your birth date in DDMMYY form <br></br>
             Follow with +/-/A, <br></br>
             (+) If you were born in the 1800s, <br></br>
             (-) If you were born in the 1900s<br></br>
             (A) If you were born in the 2000s<br></br>
             The next 3 numbers is the individual number, whicj\h is random between 002-899.<br></br>
             If your gender are male, the individual number will be odd.<br></br>
             If your gender are female, the individual number will be even.<br></br>
             At the final character, it is the control character. <br></br>
             It is established by dividing the nine-digit number consisting of a date of birth and individual number by 31. <br></br>
             The control character is determined on the basis of the remainder. <br></br>
             Below is the table of remainder and control character.
